# run-buddy
this project run-buddy is a website to connect athletes and trainers together to get in the best workouts they can!
this is a landing page to generate more leads and to hopefully convert as many clients as possible on the landing page, its a simple page written in HTML and styled with CSS to make it look better. First, the landing site for a computer was created, as well as the privacy policy page. Now, the website is being revised to make it more accessible to other devices like phones and browsers. The desktop HTML, CSS and Pricacy Page are all on the run-buddy repository main branch, and the advanced css will be pushed to a seperate branch to keep them seperate
